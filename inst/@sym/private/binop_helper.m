function z = binop_helper(x, y, scalar_fcn)
%binop_helper, private
%
%   'scalar_fcn' can either be the name of a function or a lambda.
%     example: 'lambda a,b: a % b');
%   It can also be the defn of a function called "_op"
%     e.g., { 'def _op(a,b):' '    return a % b' }
%
%   Caution: Just because you are implementing a binary operation,
%   does not mean you want to use this helper.  You shoudl use this
%   helper when you by default want per-component calculations.
%
%   FIXME: even faster if move to python_header (load once)?
